# Introduce

[Ray-tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) is a great introduction
to the computer graphics. It's originally based on c++, but I'm a big fan of rust. So I'd like to use rust to implement
the code in the book. We should be able to finish it in one weekend, having a tracer and producing some great images.

Rust is a bit different with c++, as it has a more strict static compiler. We'll need more effort to **fight with compiler**!
My rust code maybe is not the most elegant solution, so **any contribution is highly welcomed**!
